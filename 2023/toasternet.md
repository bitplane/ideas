* Buy 100 toasters from AliExpress
* Put Pi Zeroes into them
* Code on them that searches for wifi networks, and sends disconnect packets
* Connect to the network after doing this, hoping someone pressed the WPS button
* Run Tor hidden ssh service once connected, or mainline DHT publish + hole punch
* Drive to a bad part of town, leave the van door open
* Let people steal the devices and distribute them

Congratulations! You now have an anonymous network!
