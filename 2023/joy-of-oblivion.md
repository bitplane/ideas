# new consciousness idea

Start from Budnik's Realistic Monism idea - subjective experience
is the totality of existence. And t is the direction through the
universe in which entropy increases.

Now consider that evolution found a way to control the universe by making
matter feel pain, hunger, fear etc.

If it has a preference, and can be steered using that preference, then
wouldn't it make sense that the default state is the nicest base feeling?
That is, to tend towards oblivion is the most natural feeling of all; the
great release.

Though we do see stars forming, metals created, supernova, chemical
bonds and so on. So if the above is true then they probably have merit
but how far have we strayed from the base feeling? Could it be that
higher level systems are trappings that go against it, local preferences
that have been ratcheted up by evolution-like process away from the goal
of the dispersion of energy, which is much more preferable to existence
as things like atoms?

Note that this isn't a treatise on suicide. More a thought about what
might happen if we try to increase joy in the world using automated
processes that come to this conclusion, and vapourise everything to
make it a better place.
