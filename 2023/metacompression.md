make an app that has all libpng, zlib etc versions and
heuristics fur detection of version, compression ratio
block size etc.

detect the version and settings of a file

recompress to prove exact binary data

save settings as metadata, compress with something better

dedupe too

get much better compression of zip files, pngs, flac audio,
anything lossless.
