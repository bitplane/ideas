P2P chat that's crackable, by layering random cyphers
derived from the main key. The number of layers varies in
a nondeterministic way, making each message cost between
£10k and £10m to break, going up in powers of 2 in each
layer.

If enough people use it, dragnet surveillance is impossible
but serious investigations can get messages out as a
proportion of spend. This gives the judiciary a way to
say "if it's that important, you fucking pay for it!" to
law enforcement, preventing overreach.
