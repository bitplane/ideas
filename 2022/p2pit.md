The reason states have control over all of our digital life is because
services are provided by companies, who have to do as they are told.

The reason we need companies is because services cost money.

The reason they cost money is because they run on expensive hardware.

If it was all P2P, we'd break the chain of control.

It's not P2P because P2P is hard. You need a network, you need peers,
you need a bootstrap.

## solution?

Make drop-in libraries that make P2P possible with 2 peers. Just use
the bittorrent global DHT for discovery. Then new ideas can be P2P by
default, which means they don't need backing, they don't stop being
available just because a company runs out of money. The survivors can't
be bought up. Competition multiples, user freedom becomes a thing again
