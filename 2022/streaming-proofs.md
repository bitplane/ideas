How to prevent fake video in the age of AI and gov/mil control over tech?
Embed metadata from multiple orgs, corps, hardware, communities from
competing/enemy nation states.

Video is a blockchain as a proof of sequence, with Merkel tree and
proofs blocks scattered in.

## Types of proof

* Time
* Hardware
* Account ownership
* Location
* Proximity
* Work
* Stake
* Social

## Time

Time can be proven by "proof this data existed before this time" and
"proof it existed after this time"

* Before: Send an https head request to a site that includes a block hash, and
  save the whole conversation and cert chain. Website vouchers that the
  video before this block was made before the Date header time.
* After: Include a bitcoin block hash and Merkel proof in a previous
  block. Proof you know the unguessable is proof that subsequent blocks
  were made after that block time.

## Hardware

Manufacturer signs pubkeys of all components used in this device, along
with device serial number. Components periodically sign lowres copy of
their data with their privkey. Proof is embedded in a proof block.

## Account ownership

Devices and software with administration function sign "user is
authenticated" along with challenge, which is a block hash.

## Location / proximity

This is tricky. Need multiple beacons in stated locations by different
actors.

* GPS location signed by chip on device.
* Challenge/response using local radio chips. Can't beat the speed of
  light. 

## Work

Waste a small amount of electricity to prove you're not a farm.

## Stake

Some kind of bond that is locked...

## Reputation

Use social network as web of trust at time.
