Printing A2 on an A4 printer
============================

Is there an A4 printer out there that supports programmatic control of feed
in and out, the print head, can print to card, and has a feed scanner rather
than flatbed?

What?
=====

You fold the paper before putting it in, print to it, then change the fold
so that some of the previous print is shown and feed it back in again.
Then you scan it to align it, feed it back up a bit, and print just on the
white bits. Repeat the process until you have printed the full width.
