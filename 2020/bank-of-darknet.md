Say there was a bank on the darknet, the primary worry is that it'll run off
with all your money. As time goes on, abandoned accounts build up to the point
where it becomes more economical to run off with everyone's money - which I
assume is why most markets die eventually.

So what if there was a bank that took 1% of your deposit each week as a tax.
Eventually, it'd run off with all your money, but it'd be a slow and continual
exit scam that keeps the site running.

Just a thought, I don't have the stones to actually do this.
