It's possible to trace a request on a realtime network, but anonymous email remailers are provably secure.

So it ought to be possible to make a request forwarder that uses the same system as anonymous remailers, 
that collects up a bunch of HTTP(S) requests and executes them out of order, then forwards the response
through another group of forwarders.

Chaining multiple nodes together would make a web-API where nobody knows who is making the requests, 
those making the requests don't know who they're making them for, and nobody knows who the responses are for.

These things could be funded by cryptocurrency, by paying a fee in each layer. Some form of stake loss system
could ensure that the people executing the requests

NO

This would just be used as a layer between the darknet and clearnet, and would enable all kinds of activity
that the powers that be wouldn't like. I don't want to piss off NSA or GCHQ, they're bigger and stronger than
me and their governments are bullies.
