Problem
=======

The primary worry with darknet sites, either drugs markets, exchanges, mixers
or other financial services, is that they'll "exit scam" and run off with all
your money.

As time goes on, this becomes more of a risk because crypto becomes worth more
and more money, and all those abandoned accounts look like a very tasty source
of vitamins.

Solution
--------

So what if there was an online currency exchange that that took 1% of your
deposit each week as a tax. Eventually, it'd run off with all your money, but
it'd be a slow and continual exit scam that keeps the site running.

Just a thought, I don't have the stones to actually do this. I'm not going up
against NCA/GCHQ/NSA or getting extradited to the US for financial crimes.
