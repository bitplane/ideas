So, what I thought I'd do was pretend to be one of those deaf-mutes


Ingredients
-----------

 * Raspberry Pi
 * Laser pointer
 * Actuators
 * Mirror
 * Camera(s)
 * Battery pack
 * Motorcycle helmet

Method
------

So there's a bunch of projects that make a laser display using a mirror
attached to X and Y axis actuators, and drive that using the audio output
(JACK).

You can easily detect the location of a face using a webcam and OpenCV,
including the position of the eyes.

Putting the two together, you can have a helmet that, when worn, nobody
can look at you because they're getting lasers shone in their eyes.

Obviously this is a weapon that breaks the Geneva Convention, so let's not
actually make it.
